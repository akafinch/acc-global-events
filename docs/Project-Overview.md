# Global Event Processing System: Project Overview

## Project Goal
To demonstrate the power and flexibility of Akamai Compute (formerly Linode) and Zuplo by creating a globally distributed event processing system with real-time visualization capabilities. This system will showcase how modern cloud infrastructure can be leveraged to build resilient, scalable applications with sophisticated API management and monitoring capabilities.

## Business Value
- Demonstrates real-world application of cloud infrastructure at scale
- Showcases global distribution and regional failover capabilities
- Illustrates modern DevOps practices and Infrastructure as Code
- Provides tangible metrics and visualizations for system performance
- Serves as a reference architecture for similar enterprise solutions
